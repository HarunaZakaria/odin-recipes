This is my fisrt project in the odin projects and at the end of this project I will be able to demonstrate some basic understanding of HTML and CSS by building a recipe website. 
This is one of the many projects that I will be building during the foundation course.

The reason why I am buiding this website is to make my favourite recipre available on the internet so that 
others can have access to it.
this will give me the chance the use my skills in HTML an CSS to buid this site from scratch.
