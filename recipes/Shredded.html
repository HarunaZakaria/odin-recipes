            <h2>Shredded Brussels Sprouts</h2>
            <p>These shredded Brussels sprouts with bacon and pine nuts taste fantastic! 
                When I mentioned bringing Brussels sprouts to a holiday get-together, my mom told me not to bother. 
                After eating this dish, my family now requests I bring this dish to every get-together!
